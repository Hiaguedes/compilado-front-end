/*
Chessboard

Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline
characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space
or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.

Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #

When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size
= 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid
of the given width and height

    }


    return result;

console.log(ChessMatrix(8)); //here you can decide the size of the matrix

// some better answers can be made, here i tried to write a legible code

// to see the result install node and type 

//cd chapter2 in the root of the project
//node exercise3.js
